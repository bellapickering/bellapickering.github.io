# Hello and Welcome
## **Im Bella Pickering**

[![Bella ](/_uploads/bella.png)](/_uploads/bella.png)

I am third year International student at Oxford Brookes University, studying Publishing Media. Born and raised in Zimbabwe, living in Africa has been such a different experience to how most people grow up.

My Blog explores my earliest and recent memories of Zimbabwe, Exploring all the topics hardly spoken about from my own perspective.

**This is the crazy, chaotic wonderful life I live!**
