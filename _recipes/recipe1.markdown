## Ingredients

- -1.5kg live King Island cray sh or local rock lobster
- 1/4 cup (60ml) olive oil
- 1 cup saltbush leaves or flat-leaf parsley leaves
- Lemon wedges and finger lime pearls, to serve

SALTBUSH BUTTER
- 150g unsalted butter, softened
- 2 tbs finely chopped saltbush leaves or flat-leaf parsley leaves
- 1 small red chilli, seeds removed, finely chopped
- 4 garlic cloves, crushed
- Finely grated zest of 1 lemon



## Method
1. For the saltbush butter, combine all the ingredients in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper, then chill until needed.
2. Place crayfish in the freezer for 2 hours (this will put it to sleep). Place on its back on a flat, non-slip work surface with claws tied to clearly expose the under surface.
4. Place a sharp knife on the head beneath the mouth parts. Cut through the head, then backwards towards the tail. Open out to reveal the 2 parts.
6. Remove and discard the dark intestinal vein, stomach sac and gills. Crack claws slightly in half crossways with a cleaver.
8. Transfer crayfish, flesh-side up, to a baking tray and drizzle with oil. Heat a chargrill pan over high heat and add the crayfish, flesh-side down. Cook for 4 minutes or until slightly charred.
10. Turn, then, using a spoon, spread flesh with the saltbush butter. Cook for a further 8-10 minutes until the cray fish is just cooked through. Add saltbush leaves to the chargrill for the final 5 minutes of cooking to char slightly.
12. Serve the crayfish hot, scattered with charred salt bush leaves, lemon wedges and finger lime pearls.
