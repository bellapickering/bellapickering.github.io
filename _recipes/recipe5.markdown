- Prep time 30 minutes
- Cook Time 15 mins

## Ingredients

- 2 garlic cloves, crushed
- 2/3 cup (170g) mayonnaise
- 2 tablespoons thick Greek yoghurt
- 2 tablespoons flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped
- 20 (about 1kg) green tiger prawns
- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
- Lightly toasted crusty bread, to serve
- Lemon slices, to serve



## Method

1. Place the garlic, mayonnaise, yoghurt and parsley in a bowl and stir to combine. Cover and refrigerate aioli until ready to serve.
2. Using scissors, cut down the back of each prawn to reveal the intestinal tract. Pull out and discard. Rinse the prawns, then pat dry with paper towel. Place in a bowl with the olive oil and toss to coat.
3. Spread about 3 tablespoons (1/4 cup) of sea salt on a plate. Roll the prawns in the salt to coat. (The salt on the shell protects the prawn flesh during barbecuing, leaving it sweet and moist.)
4. Preheat a barbecue or chargrill on high heat. Cook the prawns for 2 minutes each side until cooked through and the shells are slightly charred. Place the prawns on a platter with the quick aioli and sliced bread. Serve with finger bowls of water with lemon slices to refresh hands after eating prawns.
