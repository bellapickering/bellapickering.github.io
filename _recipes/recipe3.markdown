- Serves: 4


## Ingredients

- 4 lobster tails
- 1 Tbsp fresh parsley, very finely chopped, plus more for garnish
- 2 garlic cloves, pressed
- 1 tsp dijon mustard
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/8 tsp black pepper
- 1 1/2 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 1/2 Tbsp fresh lemon juice
- 4 Tbsp unsalted butter, divided



### Preparation/ Butterflying the Lobster Tails
1. Use kitchen scissors to cut through the top shell of the lobster tail, stopping at the base of the tail and snipping through the top portion of the meat as you go.
2. Flip the tail over to the back see-through side of the tail and crack the ribs in the center. This will help open the shell.
3. Open the shell using your thumbs and fingers and loosen the meat from the shell (remove vein if present). Work carefully – shells can be sharp! Lift the meat from the shell, keeping it attached at the base. Press the shell together and set the lobster meat over the top. The bulk of the lobster meat should be sitting over the top of the shell.




## Method

1. 1.Place rack in center of oven so when you bake, the meaty tops of your lobster tails will be at least 6 inches from the top heating elements. Preheat the oven to broil on high heat.
2. In a small bowl, add the marinade ingredients: 1 Tbsp parsley, 2 pressed garlic cloves, 1 tsp dijon, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp pepper, 1 1/2 Tbsp olive oil and 1 1/2 Tbsp lemon juice. Stir to combine.
3. 3.Place butterflied Lobster Tails into a 9×13 or 8×12 roasting pan. Divide the marinade evenly over the tops of each lobster tail and dot each tail all over with 1/2 Tbsp of butter cut into smaller pieces
4. Broil lobster tails on high 10-11 minutes (or according to the lobster tail size – see chart below). When done, lobster meat should be opaque and white in the center and register 145˚F on an instant read thermometer. Transfer lobster tails to a serving platter and garnish with fresh parsley if desired.
5. To make the Garlic Lemon Butter: drain drippings from the roasting pan into a small saucepan and combine with remaining 2 Tbsp butter, bring to a simmer and remove from heat. Pour over lobster tails or divide into small ramekins and use as dipping sauce.



Broiling Times for Lobster Tails:
- Smaller lobsters 6 to 8 minutes
- Medium lobsters 10-11 minutes
- Larger lobsters 12-15 minutes (with rack in middle of oven)
- Broil lobster meat until opaque and white in the center, or 145˚F.
