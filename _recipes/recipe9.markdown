Serves 8
PREP TIME 20MINS
COOK TIME 15MINS

## Ingredients
- 1/3 cup (50g) cornflour
- 1/3 cup (50g) plain flour
- Sunflower oil, to deep-fry
- 500g whole squid, cleaned, tubes cut into 1cm rings, tentacles left whole (or halved if large)
- 2 tbs extra virgin olive oil
- 2 tbs finely chopped flat-leaf parsley
- 1/2 garlic clove, finely grated
- Pinch of sea salt flakes
- Lemon wedges, to serve


## Method
1. Combine flours in a bowl and season well.
2. Half-fill a deep-fryer or large saucepan with sunflower oil and heat to 180°C (a cube of bread will turn golden in 45 seconds when the oil is hot enough).
3. Working in batches, add a handful of squid rings and tentacles to the flour mixture and toss to coat thoroughly. After coating, place each batch in a sieve and shake any excess flour back into the bowl.
4. Once squid is coated in flour mixture, working in batches, deep-fry, turning halfway, for 2-3 minutes or until golden and crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon, drain on paper towel and sprinkle with salt flakes. Keep warm. Repeat with remaining squid.
5. To serve, heap the squid into a large bowl and spoon over dressing. Serve with lemon wedges.
6. To make the dressing, combine olive oil, parsley and garlic in a bowl
